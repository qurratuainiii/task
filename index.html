<center><h3>Hi, I believe that one of my strong key features is my social skills. Since primamry school, I have a lot of friends and very friendly towards stranger. I always thought that I am extrovert person but honestly I am ambivert person. I enjoy spend time with family and friends but at the same time I would like to spend time alone. During my time when I were alone, it looks like I am charging the energy to meet people </h3>
